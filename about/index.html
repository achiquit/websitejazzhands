As a non-traditional student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I pursued an exciting blend of Information Science and Psychology, allowing me to fuse my interests in technology with insights into human behavior. This interdisciplinary approach has provided me with a strong, holistic foundation on which to build my career in life coaching.<br>My love for the outdoors began during my time at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I taught climbing techniques to the climbing club and took the initiative to establish an aerial silks community on campus. These experiences not only enhanced my leadership skills but also deepened my appreciation for nature and adventure. Currently, I work as a Mountain Guide at Seneca Rocks Mountain Guides, where I share my enthusiasm for the outdoors while ensuring safety and fostering a connection with nature for my clients.<br>I am moving forward to a career in life coaching, where I can wield my down-to-earth, laid back approach to teaching and mentorship to help people to discover their own path forward.<br><br>See my <a href="/resume" class="text-emerald-300">Curriculum Vitae</a> for more information!</p>

I discovered a deep love of adventures through rock climbing with the UNC Chapel Hill climbing club; ever since my first outdoor climb <span class="date-count" data-date="2019-06-15"></span> years ago, I've been seriously engaging in outdoor pursuits. What draws me most to adventure, and what drove me to arrange my life around enabling such adventures, is the personal-growth, diverse experiences, and rare friendships garnered while engaged in a wild adventure!<br>Beyond adventuring, I dabble in a wide range of hobbies to explore and enjoy the world around me, from playing piano to making salve from foraged ingredients to building my personal website from scratch.<br>I also explore photography in an attempt to capture the beauty of the places and people my adventures take me to. Due to my light-weight tendencies and my razor thin budgets, all my photos are taken with my Google Pixel phone.<br><br>See my <a href="/photography" class="text-emerald-300">portfolio</a> to check out my photos!</p>
