                            <p class="text-gray-400 relative right-4 lg:right-0">My professional journey began with a six year run in IT User Support, where I honed my skills in troubleshooting and customer relations, helping users navigate and resolve their technical challenges. As a non-traditional student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I pursued an exciting blend of Information Science and Psychology, allowing me to fuse my passion for technology with insights into human behavior. This interdisciplinary approach has shaped my ability to understand both the technical and emotional aspects of user experiences.<br>My love for the outdoors began during my time at UNC-CH, where I taught climbing techniques with the climbing club and took the initiative to establish an aerial silks community on campus. These experiences not only enhanced my leadership skills but also deepened my appreciation for nature and adventure. Currently, I work as a Mountain Guide at Seneca Rocks Mountain Guides, where I share my enthusiasm for the outdoors while ensuring safety and fostering a connection with nature for my clients.<br>I am dedicated to continuously honing my multidisciplinary skillset, as I believe that diverse experiences contribute to a richer perspective. My goal is to leverage this knowledge and my passion for guiding to add value in future roles, whether in outdoor education, technology, or any field that allows me to inspire others.<br><br>See my <a href="/resume" class="text-emerald-300">Curriculum Vitae</a> for more information!</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-400 relative left-4 lg:left-0">I am an adventurer and a dabbler. I discovered a deep love of adventures through rock climbing with the UNC Chapel Hill climbing club; ever since my first outdoor climb <span class="date-element" data-date="2019-06-15"></span> years ago, I've been seriously engaging in outdoor pursuits. What draws me most to adventure, and what drove me to arrange my life around enabling such adventures, is the personal-growth, diverse experiences, and rare friendships garnered while engaged in a wild adventure!<br>Beyond adventuring, I dabble in a wide range of hobbies to explore and enjoy the world around me, from playing piano to making salve from foraged ingredients to building my personal website from scratch.<br>I also explore photography in an attempt, inherently feeble as it is, to capture the beauty of the places and people my adventures take me to. Due to my light-weight tendencies and my razor thin budgets, all my photos are taken with my Google Pixel phone.</p>
